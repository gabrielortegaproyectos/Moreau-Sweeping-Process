\chapter{Numerical Methods}

This chapter briefly discusses numerical methods for computing approximate projections.

\section{Computing Approximate Projections}

The practical implementation of the catching-up algorithm requires efficient methods for computing approximate projections onto closed sets.

\section{Frank-Wolfe Algorithm}

One approach for obtaining approximate projections is through the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, which can be applied when the set admits efficient computation of linear optimization problems.

\section{Separation Oracles}

For certain classes of sets defined by sublevel sets of functions, separation oracles can be employed to construct approximate projections efficiently.

\section{Implementation Considerations}

The choice of numerical method depends on the specific structure of the moving sets $C(t)$ and the required accuracy $\varepsilon$.
