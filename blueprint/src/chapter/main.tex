This document is a blueprint for the formalization in Lean 4 of the paper \textit{Catching-Up Algorithm with Approximate Projections for Moreau's Sweeping Processes} by Juan Guillermo Garrido and Emilio Vilches (2024).

The paper develops an enhanced version of the catching-up algorithm for sweeping processes through an appropriate concept of approximate projection. Under suitable assumptions, convergence is shown for three main cases: uniformly prox-regular moving sets (without compactness assumptions), boundedly compact subsmooth moving sets, and general boundedly compact fixed closed sets.
