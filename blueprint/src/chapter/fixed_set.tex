\chapter{Fixed Set Case}

This chapter addresses the convergence of the catching-up algorithm for a fixed ball-compact closed set.

\section{The Fixed Set Problem}

In this chapter, we consider the simplified case where $C(t) \equiv C$ for all $t \in [0,T]$, i.e., the set does not move in time.

\begin{theorem}[Convergence for fixed sets]
\label{thm:convergence_fixed_set}
\lean{MoreauSweeping.convergence_fixed_set}
Let $C \subset H$ be a ball-compact closed set. Under appropriate assumptions on the error sequence, the catching-up algorithm with approximate projections converges to a solution of the sweeping process with fixed set $C$.
\end{theorem}

\section{Remarks}

The fixed set case provides simpler conditions for convergence and serves as a foundation for understanding the more general moving set case.
