\chapter{Fixed Set Case}

This chapter addresses the convergence of the catching-up algorithm for a fixed boundedly compact closed set.

\section{The Fixed Set Problem}

In this chapter, we consider the simplified case where $C(t) \equiv C$ for all $t \in [0,T]$, i.e., the set does not move in time. The sweeping process reduces to:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fixed_sweeping_process}
\begin{cases}
\dot{x}(t) \in -N(C; x(t)) & \text{a.e. } t \in [0, T] \\
x(0) = x_0 \in C
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\section{Simplified Algorithm}

For a fixed set $C$, the enhanced catching-up algorithm simplifies to:
$$x_{k+1}^n \in \text{proj}_C^{\varepsilon_k^n}(x_k^n) \quad \text{for all } k \in \{0, \dots, n-1\}$$

Let $C \subset H$ be a boundedly compact closed set. Under appropriate assumptions on the error sequence, the catching-up algorithm with approximate projections converges to a solution of the sweeping process with fixed set $C$.
\end{theorem}

\section{Remarks}

The fixed set case provides simpler conditions for convergence and serves as a foundation for understanding the more general moving set case.
