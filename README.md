# Catching-Up Algorithm with Approximate Projections for Moreau's Sweeping Processes

Formalization in Lean 4 of the paper "Catching-Up Algorithm with Approximate Projections for Moreau's Sweeping Processes" by Juan Guillermo Garrido and Emilio Vilches (2024).

## About

This project formalizes the enhanced catching-up algorithm for Moreau's sweeping processes using approximate projections. The algorithm provides convergence results for prox-regular, subsmooth, and ball-compact closed sets.

## Current Status

The formalization is in progress. We are working on formalizing the basic definitions and key theorems from the paper.
